## What is this?

This is a **Claude Code skill** that enables Claude to create `.ppak` project files for the [Teenage Engineering EP-133 K.O. II](https://teenage.engineering/products/ep-133) sampler.

With this skill, you can:

- 🥁 **Generate beats** in any genre (Lo-Fi, Trap, House, Phonk, Boom Bap, etc.)
- 🎹 **Assign samples** to pads across all 4 groups (A, B, C, D)
- 🎼 **Program patterns** with precise timing and velocity
- 📦 **Export .ppak files** ready to load via the EP Sample Tool

---

## Creative Workflow 🎨

**This tool is a creative starting point, not a replacement for making music.**

Think of it like having a collaborator who can quickly sketch out ideas for you to build on:

### 🎯 Generate → Mod → Make It Yours

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   AI generates  │     │   Load it up    │     │   Make it YOUR  │
│   a foundation  │────▶│   on EP-133     │────▶│   track         │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
     Starting               Raw material           Add your samples,
     point only             to work with           FX, and creativity
```

### Use Cases

| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Beat Sketching** | Ask Claude for 10 different boom-bap variations, pick the one you like, then mod it with your own samples and FX |
| **Genre Exploration** | Want to try making jungle but don't know the drum patterns? Get a starting pattern and learn from it |
| **Random Sample Pack** | Tell Claude to fill all pads with random AI-generated samples by category (Group A = bongos, Group B = bass, etc.) as a creative constraint |
| **Quick Prototyping** | Sketch out an idea fast, then refine it manually on the hardware |

### Random Sample Pack Generator

A community-requested use case: **create projects pre-loaded with random samples as a creative starting point.**

> "Fill my pads with completely random samples - Group A only bongos, Group B bass, Group C oldschool drum machines"

The result: an empty project pre-loaded with generated samples. No beats programmed - just **raw material** to inspire your own creations. A fun creative challenge!

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│   You + Claude  │────▶│   .ppak File    │────▶│  EP Sample Tool │
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│  "Make me a     │     │  Generated by   │     │  Upload to your │
│   phonk beat"   │     │  Claude         │     │  EP-133         │
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

1. **Chat with Claude** - Describe the beat you want
2. **Claude generates** - Creates a `.ppak` project file
3. **Upload via [EP Sample Tool](https://teenage.engineering/apps/ep-sample-tool)** - Load it onto your EP-133
4. **Play and modify!** - Add your own samples, tweak velocities, add FX, make it yours

## Installation

### For Claude Code Users

1. Clone this repo into your skills directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DannyDesert/EP133-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/ep133-pak
   ```

2. The skill will automatically be available in Claude Code

### For Claude Desktop (Cowork Mode)

1. Download and unzip this repository
2. Place the `ep133-skill` folder in your mounted workspace
3. Claude will detect and use the skill when you ask about EP-133

---

## Usage

### Basic Example

Just ask Claude naturally:

> "Create a trap beat for my EP-133 with heavy 808s and hi-hat rolls"

Claude will:
1. Set up samples on the appropriate pads
2. Program the pattern with proper timing
3. Generate a `.ppak` file you can download

### Batch Generation (Pro Tip 💡)

Ask Claude to generate multiple variations at once:

> "Make me 5 different lo-fi beats - I'll pick my favorite and mod it"

This gives you options to choose from, then you add your own samples and personality.

### Getting Your Device SKU

For the generated file to work, Claude needs your device's SKU. Get it by:

1. Open [EP Sample Tool](https://teenage.engineering/apps/ep-sample-tool)
2. Connect your EP-133
3. Create a backup
4. Share the backup file with Claude

Claude will extract the SKU automatically.

### Example Prompts

| Prompt | What Claude Creates |
|--------|---------------------|
| "Make a lo-fi hip hop beat with dusty drums" | Swung groove, vinyl snares, airy hats |
| "Create a 4-on-the-floor house pattern" | Classic kick pattern, offbeat hats, disco claps |
| "I want a jungle/DnB breakbeat" | Chopped amen-style break at 160+ BPM |
| "Generate something weird and experimental" | Polyrhythmic chaos, glitchy textures |
| "Fill all pads with random percussive samples" | Empty project with samples ready to sequence |

## Technical Details

This skill documents the reverse-engineered `.ppak` file format:

- **ZIP structure** with leading-slash paths
- **TAR archive** containing pads, patterns, and settings
- **Binary pattern format** (8 bytes per event)
- **96 PPQN timing** (officially confirmed by TE documentation)
- **Group/pattern relationship** (pattern filename determines sample group)

See [references/format-details.md](references/format-details.md) for complete specifications.
